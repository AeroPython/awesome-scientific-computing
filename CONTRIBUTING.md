## This is an AWESOME list

Which means that the list does not pretend to contain all the resources available in the world. Do not add well-know software packages, basic tutorials, documentation, etc. Instead contribute with bizarre links about the topics, amazing blog posts and tutorials, new software, interesting people, fresh insights, this essential book you have red and whatever you consider awesome! 

This is not a how-to start with... or a all the things you need to know about..., but a **list of resources that you consider essential but people may not know**.
